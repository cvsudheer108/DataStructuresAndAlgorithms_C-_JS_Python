# DS & Algo - JS, Python & C#<br/>
Here I am listing a set of popular DS & Algo problem and cource code is provided in multiple languages under respective folders.

<br/>
## TOOLS:
- You can use online IDEs like repl.it OR ideone.com, but there you lack Intellisense & IDE debugging capability
- I am using VS Code for coding in all these languages
    - JS
        - install node & npm
        - Open a new termianl that contains the js file and run the module
        - Run : >node fizzBuzz.js
    - Python
        - install python3
        - Open a new termianl that contains the js file and run the module
        - Run : >python fizzBuzz.py
    - For C#, you need to install .net core SDK ( I use 3.1)
    - Create Project : Open the terminal on the new folder and:
        - >dontnet new console
        - >dotnet restore
        - >dontnet run, after finishing code
        - TO debug, click F5 and VVCode will create the required consigurations to debug a .netCore project in : launch.jsom

## 0. CommonTasks
    - Read/write from file
    - Many times, these logic are par of the algo code
    - Read from file - input.txt and write to file: output.txt
    - input.txt has one int per line
    - Write number to outfile, if the input line is a valid number

### 1. FizzBuzz<br/>
NOTES:<br/>
    - Task : Print number from 1 to n
        - If divisible by 3: print Fizz, if by 5 : Buzz, by both : FizzBuzz
    - Clarifications - 
    - Design - Use a loop and modulus operator
    - Coding-
    - Testing- 
    - Analysis:
        - RunTime Complexity : How does the program run time change as the inout changes - O(n) since we have to loop through each iteam and operate on it.
